	<h1>The Q Programming Language</h1>
	<p>Q is a minimal, dependency-free programming language and compiler targeting x86-64 and arm64 with ultra-fast builds and tiny binaries.</p>
</div>

## Features

* High performance (`ssa` and `asm` optimizations)
* Fast compilation (<100 Œºs for simple programs)
* Tiny executables ("Hello World" is ~600 bytes)
* Multiple platforms (Linux, Mac and Windows)
* Zero dependencies (no llvm, no libc)

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> `q` is under heavy development and not ready for production yet.
>
> Please read [this](https://lobste.rs/s/t7osqo/q_programming_language).
>
> Feel free to [contact me](https://urbach.dev/contact) if you are interested in helping out.

Build from source:

```shell
git clone https://git.urbach.dev/cli/q
cd q
go build
```

Install via symlink:

```shell
ln -s $PWD/q ~/.local/bin/q
```

## Usage

Run `hello` example:

```shell
q examples/hello
```

Build an executable:

```shell
q build examples/hello
```

Build for another architecture:

```shell
q build examples/hello --arch arm
q build examples/hello --arch x86
```

Build for another operating system:

```shell
q build examples/hello --os linux
q build examples/hello --os mac
q build examples/hello --os windows
```

## News

- 2025-08-12: Added support for Windows on arm64.
- 2025-08-11: Added support for Mac on arm64.

## Syntax

> [!NOTE]
> This is a draft.

[hello.q](../examples/hello/hello.q):

```
import io

main() {
	io.write("Hello\n")
}
```

[fibonacci.q](../examples/fibonacci/fibonacci.q)

```
fibonacci(n int) -> int {
	if n <= 1 {
		return n
	}

	return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}
```

[gcd.q](../examples/gcd/gcd.q)

```
gcd(a int, b int) -> int {
	loop {
		switch {
			a == b { return a }
			a > b  { a -= b }
			_      { b -= a }
		}
	}
}
```

[fizzbuzz.q](../examples/fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.q):

```
fizzbuzz(n int) {
	loop x := 1..n+1 {
		switch {
			x % 15 == 0 { io.write("FizzBuzz") }
			x % 5 == 0  { io.write("Buzz") }
			x % 3 == 0  { io.write("Fizz") }
			_           { io.writeInt(x) }
		}

		if x != n {
			io.write(" ")
		}
	}
}
```

The work is currently being focused on the correctness of the compiler and the proper code generation for all architectures and operating systems. The language syntax is highly volatile at this point but you can take a look at the [examples](../examples) or the [tests](../tests) to get a perspective on the current status. Documentation for all language features will follow once the core systems are stable.

## FAQ

### Which platforms are supported?

|            | arm64 | x86-64 |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| üêß Linux   | ‚úîÔ∏è    | ‚úîÔ∏è     |
| üçè Mac     | ‚úîÔ∏è    | ‚úîÔ∏è     |
| ü™ü Windows | ‚úîÔ∏è    | ‚úîÔ∏è     |

### How tiny is a Hello World?

|            | arm64      | x86-64    |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| üêß Linux   |  646 bytes | 582 bytes |
| üçè Mac     |   16.3 KiB |   4.2 KiB |
| ü™ü Windows |    1.7 KiB |   1.7 KiB |

This table often raises the question why Mac builds are so huge compared to the rest. The answer is in [these few lines](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/e3723e1f17661b24996789d8afc084c0c3303b26/bsd/kern/mach_loader.c#L2021-L2027) of their kernel code. None of the other operating systems force you to page-align sections on disk. In practice, however, it's not as bad as it sounds because the padding is a zero-filled area that barely consumes any disk space in [sparse files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file).

### How is the assembly code quality?

The backend uses an SSA based IR which is also used by well established compilers like `gcc`, `go` and `llvm`. SSA makes it trivial to apply lots of common optimization passes to it. As such, the quality of the generated assembly is fairly high despite the young age of the project.

### How do I use it for scripting?

The compiler is actually so fast that it's possible to compile an entire script within microseconds.

```q
#!/usr/bin/env q

import io

main() {
	io.write("Hello\n")
}
```

Create a file with the contents above and add permissions via `chmod +x`. Now you can execute it from anywhere. The generated machine code runs directly from RAM if the OS supports it.

### Which security features are supported?

#### PIE

All executables are built as position independent executables supporting a dynamic base address.

#### W^X

All memory pages are loaded with either execute or write permissions but never with both. Constant data is read-only.

|        | Read | Execute | Write |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| Code   | ‚úîÔ∏è   | ‚úîÔ∏è      | ‚ùå    |
| Data   | ‚úîÔ∏è   | ‚ùå      | ‚ùå    |

### Any editor extensions?

- VS Code (basic highlighting): Clone the [vscode-q](https://git.urbach.dev/extra/vscode-q) repository into your extensions folder
- Neovim support is planned.

### Why Go and not language X?

Because of readability, maintainability and great tools for concurrency.
The implementation will be replaced by a self-hosted compiler in the future.

### How do I pronounce the name?

/ÀàkjuÀê/ just like `q` in the English alphabet.

### I can't contribute but can I donate to the project?

Yes, you can [donate](https://buy.stripe.com/4gw7vf5Jxflf83m7st) if you live in a country supported by Stripe.
The payment is classified as a "cash donation".

### If I donate, what will my money be used for?

Server infrastructure and support for existing and new architectures.
